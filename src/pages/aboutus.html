        My name is Alexanny Nunez, and I’m an 11th grade student at the High School for Global Citizenship and the Brooklyn STEAM Center. I’m studying Full Stack Web Development and have experience creating websites and even a chat-based game. I enjoy coding because it lets me explore new ideas and bring them to life. One of my biggest passions is raising awareness about plastic waste, especially in cities like New York. I’m inspired by websites like Too Good To Go that use tech to make a real difference. My goal is to build websites that not only work well but also leave a lasting impact on the world.
