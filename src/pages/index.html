        The world produces around 350 million tonnes
        of plastic waste each year and the number of
        waste is only expected to grow even higher as
        the years come. Many people have attempted
        to solve the issue from only recycling and
        boycotting but its not too hard to forget that
        upcycling and reusing are a great way of
        attempting to fix the amount of plastic waste
        we produce. At Eco Bloom we use all plastic
        waste from your area to upcycle, turning your
        plastic water bottle into a cute bracelet or
        earings</p>

   <p class="text-deco-800 text-2xl  border-deco-00 text-center">New York City produces around 44 million pounds of garbage every
day, and while waste is a citywide issue, not all neighborhoods are
treated equally. Some areas tend to have better sanitation services,
while low-income communities — often Black and Brown
neighborhoods like Hunts Point, Longwood, and Melrose in the
Bronx, where nearly 29% of residents live below the poverty line —
face higher levels of trash, fewer resources, and long-standing
neglect.

Eco Bloom's mission is to reduce plastic waste in
New York by 25% within our first year of business,
starting with these underserved areas. Through
upcycling locally collected trash, we aim to turn
waste into opportunity — creating jobs, cleaner
streets, and a model for sustainable change
rooted in environmental justice.
