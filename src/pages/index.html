            The world produces around 350 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, and that number is only expected to
            grow in the coming years. Many people have tried to address the issue through
            recycling and boycotting, but it's important to remember that upcycling and reusing are also effective ways
            to reduce the plastic waste we generate. At Eco Bloom, we upcycle all plastic waste from your area—
            transforming plastic water bottles into cute bracelets, or earrings.

        New York City produces over 44 million pounds of trash every single day — and a growing share of that is plastic. While recycling efforts exist, less than 10% of plastic is actually recycled, with the rest ending up in landfills, incinerators, or littering our streets. The burden of this waste isn’t shared equally — low-income neighborhoods like Hunts Point, Longwood, and Melrose in the Bronx face the highest levels of pollution and the fewest resources to fight it. At Eco Bloom, we believe it’s time for change. By collecting and upcycling local plastic waste into wearable, beautiful products, we’re turning trash into opportunity — reducing pollution, creating local jobs, and promoting environmental justice where it’s needed most.

        What can we do in a city overwhelmed by plastic waste, where 44 million pounds of garbage are thrown out every day?
        We can start by rethinking waste — not as something to be discarded, but as raw material for creativity, change, and empowerment.
        At Eco Bloom, we collect plastic from New York City’s underserved neighborhoods — communities that face the harshest effects of pollution and the fewest solutions.
        Instead of letting this plastic sit in landfills or pile up on city streets, we transform it into something new: bold, beautiful accessories with a purpose.

        Upcycling takes materials that would otherwise be discarded and turns them into something new, valuable, and purposeful.
Instead of sending plastic waste to landfills, we repurpose it into unique products like accessories, helping to reduce the overwhelming plastic pollution that clutters our streets and oceans.
This process not only keeps waste out of landfills but also reduces the need for virgin materials, saving energy and resources.
By upcycling, we create a circular economy where waste is minimized, and products are made with a lower environmental footprint.
