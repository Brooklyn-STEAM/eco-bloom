            The world produces around 350 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, and that number is only expected to
            grow in the coming years. Many people have tried to address the issue through
            recycling and boycotting, but it's important to remember that upcycling and reusing are also effective ways
            to reduce the plastic waste we generate. At Eco Bloom, we upcycle all plastic waste from your area—
            transforming plastic water bottles into cute bracelets, or earrings.

                New York City produces around 44 million pounds of garbage every
                day, and while waste is a citywide issue, not all neighborhoods are
                treated equally. Some areas tend to have better sanitation services,
                while low-income communities — often Black and Brown
                neighborhoods like Hunts Point, Longwood, and Melrose in the
                Bronx, where nearly 29% of residents live below the poverty line —
                face higher levels of trash, fewer resources, and long-standing
                neglect. Eco Bloom's mission is to reduce plastic waste in
                New York by 25% within our first year of business,
                starting with these underserved areas. Through
                upcycling locally collected trash, we aim to turn
                waste into opportunity — creating jobs, cleaner
                streets, and a model for sustainable change
                rooted in environmental justice.
